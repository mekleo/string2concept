Utility to extract all concepts contained in a text.

It is based on its own core data structures and algorithms\+: Vector, Hash\+Table, String, Hash. They are optimized to minimize copies and heap allocations.

The C++ class Concept\+Extractor implements the main algorithm. It is a variant of Rabin-\/\+Karp pattern searching. It differs from vanilla Rabin-\/\+Karp by the variable-\/length patterns and because the number of comparisions is linear with the number of words, rather that linear with the number of characters.

We intend to search for a huge number of concepts of various lengths in an input text. For reaching linear time complexity on average, independent from the number of concepts, we store concepts in a Hash table keyed by lowercase words. As core data structure, the Hash table is designed as follows \+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item the keys are lowercased concepts or the first word of concepts
\item the values are pairs of the key in its original case , and a vector of concepts lengths (number of words)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If that length is one, the item itself is a concept
\item If that length m is greater than 1, there exist concepts of size m in the hashtable.Whenever we find an input word in the Hash\+Table, we try to find the next m words. Every match for the expected length is a Concept and must be returned.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

This algorithm\textquotesingle{}s complexity in time is, on average, linear with the number k of words in input + the average number l of words in the concepts To that, we add a linear term for an initial segmentation of the text into words (zero-\/copy process) i.\+e. O(k + l) + O(n). Its theoretical worst-\/case is O(k$\ast$l) + O(n). That only occurs in the hypothetical case where all hashes collide. This implies a rather poor hash function.

We prefer this algorithm to the Aho-\/\+Corasick algorithm (AC). While AC achieves an interesting linear asymptotic worst-\/case time complexity O(n + m), our algorithm might be faster because, as it jumps from word to word, it achieves less comparisions. Indeed, Aho-\/\+Corasick\textquotesingle{}s automata are character-\/oriented.
